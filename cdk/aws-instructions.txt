**Connect to EC2 instance:**
Note: Call this from the same folder where "CtfBackendKeyPair.pem" is saved.

Command:
ssh -i CtfBackendKeyPair.pem ec2-user@ec2-18-207-108-100.compute-1.amazonaws.com

Once you are connected to the EC2 instance you can use "docker ps" to see the
running containers and use "docker exec -it <container-name> /bin/sh" to connect
to a container.



**Create SSH tunnel to RDS instance**
Note: Call this from the same folder where "CtfBackendKeyPair.pem" is saved.
Note: It is expected that this call will not return.

Command:
ssh -N -L 10101:ctf-db-instance.cwjk3wcpcb5v.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432 -i CtfBackendKeyPair.pem ec2-user@ec2-18-207-108-100.compute-1.amazonaws.com`

With the SSH tunnel open, in another terminal interact with the database via
localhost port 10101.

Example commands:
Note: You will be prompted to enter the database password.

Command to connect to database: 
psql -h localhost -p 10101 -U postgres

Command to run a .sql script stored locally on your computer:
psql -h localhost -p 10101 -U postgres -d aact -f path/to/your-script.sql`
