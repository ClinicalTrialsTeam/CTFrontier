## About

The AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) is an open source software development framework to define AWS cloud application resources using code. This project uses AWS CDK in Python to define project resources.

The project also includes a command line utility for interacting with CDK. This command line utility wraps many of the standard CDK commands and some AWS CLI commands to provide additional functionality.

Acknowledgement to https://github.com/harvard-dce/zoom-recording-ingester for the ideas for general file structure
for setting up the CDK project. This project's CLI tool for interacting with CDK is also inspired by
the invoke tasks CLI tool used by zoom ingester however this project uses the Click library (<https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/>) rather than Invoke (<http://www.pyinvoke.org/>).
